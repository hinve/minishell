steps export : 

To imitate the behavior of the export command in a shell, you need to follow these steps:

Check for Arguments:

If no arguments are provided, print the current environment variables in a sorted manner.
Validate the Argument:

Check if the provided argument is a valid environment variable name. This involves ensuring it starts with a letter or underscore and is followed by letters, digits, or underscores. If the argument is invalid, print an error message.
Check for Existing Variable:

Determine if the environment variable already exists in the environment list. If it does, update its value.
Add New Variable:

If the environment variable does not exist, add it to the environment list.
Update Environment List:

If the variable is valid and does not already exist, add it to the environment list. If it exists, update its value.
Handle Errors:

If any errors occur during validation or updating, print appropriate error messages.
Detailed Steps:
Check for Arguments:

If no arguments are provided, call a function to print the current environment variables in a sorted order.
Validate the Argument:

Use a function to check if the argument is a valid environment variable name.
If the argument starts with an =, mark it as invalid.
If the argument is invalid, call a function to print an error message and return.
Check for Existing Variable:

Use a function to check if the environment variable already exists in the environment list.
If it exists, update its value.
Add New Variable:

If the environment variable does not exist, add it to the environment list.
Allocate memory for the new variable and set its key and value.
Update Environment List:

If the variable is valid and does not already exist, add it to the environment list.
If it exists, update its value.
Handle Errors:

If any errors occur during validation or updating, call a function to print appropriate error messages.
By following these steps, you can imitate the behavior of the export command in a shell.
